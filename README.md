backbone.marionette.signatures
=======================

This is effectivly intended to be `cliffsnotes` style documentation in-code.

The idea here is that you can cut-n-paste these 80-col comment sections
into your marionette code while you are writting it.

I have found this is particuarly helpfull while writting new marionette views.

Its also helpful when trying to figure out what events are being emmited and from whom.

This was put together from reading the source of these versions of the library's.

  - Backbone [v1.1.2] [anotated-source](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html)
  - Backbone.Marionette [v2.1.0] [anotated-source](http://marionettejs.com/annotated-src/backbone.marionette)
